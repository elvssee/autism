PROBLEM STATEMENT
Early ASD detection in infants/toddlers is critical but often delayed.
Traditional diagnosis is costly, time-consuming, and requires clinical experts.
Rural and under-resourced regions lack access to screening facilities.
Parents may be unaware of early behavioral signs of ASD.
A simple, accessible, and AI-based tool is needed for early screening and awareness.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
Develop a web-based platform for preliminary ASD screening.
Use an AI-driven questionnaire to assess behavioral traits from real ASD datasets.
Integrate webcam-based facial analysis (CNN model) to detect emotional cues.
Provide real-time feedback and ASD awareness resources to parents.
