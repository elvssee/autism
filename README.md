PROBLEM STATEMENT

Early ASD detection in infants/toddlers is critical but often delayed.

Traditional diagnosis is costly, time-consuming, and requires clinical experts.

Rural and under-resourced regions lack access to screening facilities.

Parents may be unaware of early behavioral signs of ASD.

A simple, accessible, and AI-based tool is needed for early screening and awareness.

To help parents find early signs of autism in toddlers using AI

To give quick and clear feedback on the child’s behavior
