PROBLEM STATEMENT
Early ASD detection in infants/toddlers is critical but often delayed.
Traditional diagnosis is costly, time-consuming, and requires clinical experts.
Rural and under-resourced regions lack access to screening facilities.
Parents may be unaware of early behavioral signs of ASD.
A simple, accessible, and AI-based tool is needed for early screening and awareness.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES
To Develop a secure, user-friendly web-based platform for the preliminary screening of Autism Spectrum Disorder  in children
To Implement an AI-driven adaptive questionnaire system
To Integrate real-time webcam-based facial emotion recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
